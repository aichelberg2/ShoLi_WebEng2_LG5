People who become students at a university or similar institutions, often get a problem with time management. In such a situation, the last thing a person would want is to invest time into organizing shopping with their fellow roommates, friends or family.

People can interact with the shopping assistant through a website, an app on a mobile advice and with an Alexa device.
